== About ==

Acrolinx is an extension to MediaWiki that allows for using the
proprietary Acrolinx "content optimization" service when editing
wiki pages.

For more information on the Acrolinx extension, see its homepage at
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Acrolinx

== Setup ==

* Clone/extract the extension into the `/extensions` folder of your wiki
* Add `wfLoadExtension('Acrolinx');` to the bottom of your `/LocalSettings.php` file

Note: if you'd like to use the Acrolinx spellcheck with VisualEditor extension you
need to apply a patch for the VisualEditor, follow the steps below:

* copy the `VisualEditor.diff` to the `/extensions/VisualEditor/lib/ve` folder
* cd into the `/extensions/VisualEditor/lib/ve` folder
* run `git apply VisualEditor.diff`

== Credits ==

The Acrolinx extension was created by Yaron Koren. It uses
JavaScript code developed by both Acrolinx and Google, as well as
CSS code developed by Acrolinx, all available under the Apache 2.0
license, which is compatible with the GPLv3 license under which
this extension is released.
